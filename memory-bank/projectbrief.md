# Project Brief: Enhanced n8n WordPress Node

## 1. Project Goal
To develop an enhanced WordPress node for n8n with expanded capabilities, improving its functionality and user experience for WordPress integrations.

## 2. Core Requirements
The new node must support:
- Custom Post Types (CPTs)
- Media Uploads and Management
- User Management
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) integration
- Improved authentication (Basic, OAuth2, Application Passwords)
- Advanced field mapping for custom fields and nested structures
- Better error handling and retry logic
- Auto-discovery features for CPTs and ACF fields
- Performance optimizations

## 3. Scope
- **In Scope:**
    - Development of a new n8n node for WordPress.
    - Implementation of all features listed in Core Requirements.
    - Prioritization of CPTs, Media, Users, and ACF.
    - Auto-discovery of CPTs and relevant ACF fields.
    - Adherence to n8n node development best practices, using "n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter" as a reference.
- **Out of Scope (Initially):**
    - Full support for all WordPress entities (e.g., comments, taxonomies beyond basic CPT/ACF needs will be secondary).
    - UI/UX design beyond standard n8n node capabilities.

## 4. Success Criteria
- The node is accepted and usable within the n8n ecosystem.
- All prioritized features (CPTs, Media, Users, ACF) are fully functional.
- Auto-discovery mechanisms work reliably.
- Authentication methods are secure and robust.
- The node demonstrates improved performance and error handling compared to existing solutions.
