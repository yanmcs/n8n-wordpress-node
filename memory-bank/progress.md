# Progress: Enhanced n8n WordPress Node

## 1. What Works
- **Initial Planning:** Completed.
- **Memory Bank Setup:** All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created with initial content.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level)
- **Core Node Structure:**
    - Set up project based on `n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter`.
    - Define `WordPress.node.ts`.
    - Implement credential types for Basic Auth, OAuth2, and Application Passwords.
- **Prioritized Features:**
    - **Custom Post Types (CPTs):**
        - Auto-discovery mechanism.
        - CRUD operations.
    - **Media Management:**
        - Upload, retrieve, delete operations.
    - **User Management:**
        - Retrieve, create, update, delete users (as per API capabilities).
    - **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):**
        - Auto-discovery of ACF fields for selected CPTs.
        - Mapping and updating ACF data (including nested fields).
- **General Enhancements:**
    - Advanced field mapping UI/logic.
    - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic.
    - Performance optimizations.
- **Secondary Features (Post-Prioritized):**
    - Comments management.
    - Full taxonomy management.
- **Testing:**
    - Unit and integration tests for all features.

## 3. Current Status
- **Phase:** Project Initialization and Setup.
- **Current Activity:** Memory Bank files established. Preparing to gather information on `n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter` using Context7.

## 4. Known Issues
- None at this stage.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Plan:** Broad scope covering many WordPress features.
- **Refined Plan (User Feedback):** Prioritized CPTs, Media, Users, and ACF, with auto-discovery as a key component for CPTs and ACF. This allows for a focused initial development effort on the most critical features.
